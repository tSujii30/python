SIMPLE CONTACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This python program  implements a simple contact management system using object-oriented programming principles. It features a Contact class to represent individual contacts, storing attributes like name, phone, and email. The ContactManager class handles various operations on the contact list, including adding, editing, deleting, searching, and displaying contacts. The main function provides a user interface to interact with the contact manager, allowing users to perform these operations through a menu-driven interface. This project showcases basic Python concepts such as class methods, lists, and input handling, making it suitable for demonstrating intermediate-level programming skills.
